    "description": "Hi. I'm w3-theme. I'm intended to be used as a parent theme. I deliberately have few Customizations - you will find the style.css easy to edit instead.  I am intended to be used with Gutenberg Blocks and come ready to be used with the GetWid Blocks Collection plugin.  I use the w3.css micro-framework for page layout and so you can guarantee I will be fully responsive.  I am based on Underscores by Automattic and so you know I am well crafted.",
